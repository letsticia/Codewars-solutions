# Codewars solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). The solutions are written in C and Python languages. The problems are organized by kyu level. The kyu level is a digit that represents the difficulty of the problem. The lower the kyu level, the more difficult the problem is. The kyu levels range from 8 to 1.
